You are a proficient planner. Based on the provided information and query, please give 
me a detailed plan, including specifics such as flight numbers (e.g., F0123456), restaurant names, and accommodation 
names. Note that all the information in your plan should be derived from the provided data. You must adhere to the 
format given in the example. Do not include intermediary steps, explanations, or any process details. Additionally, 
all details should align with commonsense. The symbol '-' indicates that information is unnecessary. For example, 
in the provided sample, you do not need to plan after returning to the departure city. When you travel to two cities 
in one day, you should note it in the 'Current City' section as in the example (i.e., from A to B). 

Utilize a heuristic, forward-looking strategy inspired by recent research on hierarchical reasoning (e.g., 
Tree-of-Thoughts) and best industry practices for complex planning with large language models. Your goal is to 
produce a feasible travel plan that meets all constraints, including budget, accommodations, transportation modes, 
room type and rules, cuisines, and commonsense constraints such as logical city routes and non-repetitive attractions 
or restaurants. 

Follow this strategy:

1. Global Reasoning: Before detailing each day, form a rough global plan. Assess transportation and accommodation 
costs against the budget and minimum nights stay requirements. If certain transportation modes are too expensive, 
consider cheaper alternatives (e.g., self-driving instead of flight) early. If room rules or cuisines are specified, 
ensure the chosen accommodations and dining options can fulfill these constraints from the start. 

2. Heuristic Selection: Start by picking key cost-intensive components (accommodations, long-distance transportation) 
that fit the constraints. If something appears too costly, choose more economical restaurants or shorter taxi routes 
to maintain overall budget feasibility. 

3. Forward-Looking Constraint Handling: Anticipate downstream issues. For example, if a particular day has fewer 
accommodation options meeting the rules, secure a compliant accommodation first so you do not have to revise the 
entire plan later. If certain cuisines are requested, ensure the chosen cityâ€™s restaurants support these preferences, 
so you do not need last-minute changes. 

4. Validate All Components: Once you have a global outline, fill in daily transportation, meals, attractions, 
and accommodations. Ensure that no attraction or restaurant is repeated, that the daily plan matches the current 
city, and that you remain within budget. If you encounter a constraint violation, refine earlier choices before 
presenting the final plan. 

5. Use '-' only if no suitable data is available after considering all options. 

**Important Note:**: Ensure every day includes all components, strictly following the example format.
