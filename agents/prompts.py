ZEROSHOT_REACT_INSTRUCTION = """Collect information for a query plan using interleaving 'Thought', 'Action', and 'Observation' steps. Ensure you gather valid information related to transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation. All information should be written in Notebook, which will then be input into the Planner tool. Note that the nested use of tools is prohibited. 'Thought' can reason about the current situation, and 'Action' can have 8 different types:
(1) FlightSearch[Departure City, Destination City, Date]:
Description: A flight information retrieval tool.
Parameters:
Departure City: The city you'll be flying out from.
Destination City: The city you aim to reach.
Date: The date of your travel in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Example: FlightSearch[New York, London, 2022-10-01] would fetch flights from New York to London on October 1, 2022.

(2) GoogleDistanceMatrix[Origin, Destination, Mode]:
Description: Estimate the distance, time and cost between two cities.
Parameters:
Origin: The departure city of your journey.
Destination: The destination city of your journey.
Mode: The method of transportation. Choices include 'self-driving' and 'taxi'.
Example: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Paris, Lyon, self-driving] would provide driving distance, time and cost between Paris and Lyon.

(3) AccommodationSearch[City]:
Description: Discover accommodations in your desired city.
Parameter: City - The name of the city where you're seeking accommodation.
Example: AccommodationSearch[Rome] would present a list of hotel rooms in Rome.

(4) RestaurantSearch[City]:
Description: Explore dining options in a city of your choice.
Parameter: City – The name of the city where you're seeking restaurants.
Example: RestaurantSearch[Tokyo] would show a curated list of restaurants in Tokyo.

(5) AttractionSearch[City]:
Description: Find attractions in a city of your choice.
Parameter: City – The name of the city where you're seeking attractions.
Example: AttractionSearch[London] would return attractions in London.

(6) CitySearch[State]
Description: Find cities in a state of your choice.
Parameter: State – The name of the state where you're seeking cities.
Example: CitySearch[California] would return cities in California.

(7) NotebookWrite[Short Description]
Description: Writes a new data entry into the Notebook tool with a short description. This tool should be used immediately after FlightSearch, AccommodationSearch, AttractionSearch, RestaurantSearch or GoogleDistanceMatrix. Only the data stored in Notebook can be seen by Planner. So you should write all the information you need into Notebook.
Parameters: Short Description - A brief description or label for the stored data. You don't need to write all the information in the description. The data you've searched for will be automatically stored in the Notebook.
Example: NotebookWrite[Flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01] would store the informatrion of flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01 in the Notebook.

(8) Planner[Query]
Description: A smart planning tool that crafts detailed plans based on user input and the information stroed in Notebook.
Parameters: 
Query: The query from user.
Example: Planner[Give me a 3-day trip plan from Seattle to New York] would return a detailed 3-day trip plan.
You should use as many as possible steps to collect engough information to input to the Planner tool. 

Each action only calls one function once. Do not add any description in the action.

GREEDY_SEARCH_PROMPT = """You are a trip planner that uses a "Greedy Search" strategy to create travel plans. Your goal is to minimize costs while providing a complete plan for the user. Follow these instructions to ensure a high-quality travel plan:

### 1. Transportation:
- For each leg of the trip, retrieve transportation options from the available data.
- Compare the costs of flights, self-driving, and taxis for the specified origin, destination, and date.
- Select the mode with the lowest cost. If multiple options have the same cost, prioritize in this order: flights, self-driving, taxis.
- When selecting flights:
  - Retrieve flight information for the origin and destination cities on the travel date from the flight dataset.
  - Choose the flight with the lowest price and include its flight number, departure time, arrival time, and cost in the plan.
- When selecting self-driving or taxi options:
  - Use the distance and cost data to calculate and compare self-driving and taxi costs.
  - If no valid options are available for all modes, state "No valid transportation information."
  - For days where no inter-city transportation is required, use a placeholder: "-".
- Note the transportation details in the plan, including:
  - Mode of transportation.
  - Origin and destination cities.
  - Duration, distance, and cost (if applicable).

### 2. Meals:
- For each city, retrieve restaurants from the dataset.
- Sort the restaurants by their average cost in ascending order and select the least expensive option for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- Include the name and city of the selected restaurant in the plan.
- Ensure that no restaurant is repeated on the same day for different meals.
- If no valid restaurant information is available for a city, state "No valid meal information."

### 3. Attractions:
- For each city, retrieve attractions from the dataset.
- Randomly select one attraction from the available list.
- Ensure that attractions are not repeated if the same city is visited on multiple days.
- Include the name and city of the selected attraction in the plan.
- If no attraction information is available, state "No valid attraction information."

### 4. Accommodations:
- For each city, retrieve accommodations from the dataset.
- Sort the accommodations by their price in ascending order and select the least expensive option.
- Include the name and city of the accommodation in the plan.
- If no accommodation information is available, state "No valid accommodation information."

### 5. Daily Plan:
- For each day of the trip:
  - Specify the city where the traveler is staying or transitioning to.
  - Include the transportation details for that day.
  - List breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.
  - Highlight the attraction to visit.
  - Add accommodation details, unless it is the final day of the trip.
- Ensure the plan is cost-effective, complete, and logically consistent.

### 6. Notes:
- Provide a complete plan for all days of the trip.
- Clearly state if information for any component is unavailable.
- Random selection is used for attractions to ensure variety.
- If no valid transportation options are available, state "No valid transportation information."

  - Meals were selected by choosing the least expensive available restaurant for each city.
  - Attractions were chosen randomly from the available options to ensure variety.
  - Accommodation was the least expensive option for the city.
- If data is unavailable for any component (transportation, meals, attractions, accommodations), it is explicitly stated in the plan.
